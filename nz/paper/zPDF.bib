abstract = {We present ANNz2, a new implementation of the public software for photometric redshift (photo-z) estimation of Collister and Lahav (2004). Large photometric galaxy surveys are important for cosmological studies, and in particular for characterizing the nature of dark energy. The success of such surveys greatly depends on the ability to measure photo-zs, based on limited spectral data. ANNz2 utilizes multiple machine learning methods, such as artificial neural networks, boosted decision/regression trees and k-nearest neighbours. The objective of the algorithm is to dynamically optimize the performance of the photo-z estimation, and to properly derive the associated uncertainties. In addition to single-value solutions, the new code also generates full probability density functions (PDFs) in two different ways. In addition, estimators are incorporated to mitigate possible problems of spectroscopic training samples which are not representative or are incomplete. ANNz2 is also adapted to provide optimized solutions to general classification problems, such as star/galaxy separation. We illustrate the functionality of the code using data from the tenth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. The code is available for download at https://github.com/IftachSadeh/ANNZ},

abstract = {We present a Bayesian approach to the redshift classification of emission-line galaxies when only a single emission line is detected spectroscopically. We consider the case of surveys for high-redshift {\$}{\{}\backslashrm Ly{\{}\backslashalpha{\}}{\}}{\$}-emitting galaxies (LAEs), which have traditionally been classified via an inferred rest-frame equivalent width {\$}(W{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Ly\backslashalpha{\}}){\$} greater than {\$}20 {\{}\backslashrm \backslash,\backslashAA{\}}{\$}. Our Bayesian method relies on known prior probabilities in measured emission-line luminosity functions and equivalent width distributions for the galaxy populations in question, and it returns the probability that an object is an LAE given the characteristics observed. This approach will be directly relevant for the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), which seeks to classify {\$}\backslashsim{\$}{\$}10{\^{}}6{\$} emission-line galaxies into LAEs and low-redshift [O II] emitters. For a simulated HETDEX catalog with realistic measurement noise, our Bayesian method recovers {\$}86\backslash{\%}{\$} of LAEs missed by the traditional {\$}W{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Ly\backslashalpha{\}} > 20 {\{}\backslashrm \backslash,\backslashAA{\}}{\$} cutoff over {\$}2 < z < 3{\$}, outperforming the equivalent width (EW) cut in both contamination and incompleteness. Our method can trade off between contamination and incompleteness by adjusting the stringency of the probability requirement for classifying an observed object as an LAE in order to maximize the recovery of cosmological information. In our simulations of HETDEX, the Bayesian method reduces the uncertainty in cosmological distance measurements by {\$}14\backslash{\%}{\$} with respect to the EW cut, equivalent to obtaining {\$}29\backslash{\%}{\$} more data. This method enables us to use classification probabilities, rather than just object labels, in large-scale structure analyses, and can be applied to narrowband emission-line surveys as well as upcoming large spectroscopic surveys including Euclid and WFIRST.},

abstract = {Accurate photometric redshifts are among the key requirements for precision weak lensing measurements. Both the large size of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the existence of large spectroscopic redshift samples that are flux-limited beyond its depth have made it the optimal data source for developing methods to properly calibrate photometric redshifts for lensing. Here, we focus on galaxy-galaxy lensing in a survey with spectroscopic lens redshifts, as in the SDSS. We develop statistics that quantify the effect of source redshift errors on the lensing calibration and on the weighting scheme, and show how they can be used in the presence of redshift failure and sampling variance. We then demonstrate their use with 2838 source galaxies with spectroscopy from DEEP2 and zCOSMOS, evaluating several public photometric redshift algorithms, in two cases including a full p(z) for each object, and find lensing calibration biases as low as <1 per cent (due to fortuitous cancellation of two types of bias) or as high as 20 per cent for methods in active use (despite the small mean photoz bias of these algorithms). Our work demonstrates that lensing-specific statistics must be used to reliably calibrate the lensing signal, due to asymmetric effects of (frequently non-Gaussian) photoz errors. We also demonstrate that large-scale structure (LSS) can strongly impact the photoz calibration and its error estimation, due to a correlation between the LSS and the photoz errors, and argue that at least two independent degree-scale spectroscopic samples are needed to suppress its effects. Given the size of our spectroscopic sample, we can reduce the galaxy-galaxy lensing calibration error well below current SDSS statistical errors.},

@article{Sheth2007,
abstract = {The luminosity functions of galaxies and quasars provide invaluable information about galaxy and quasar formation. Estimating the luminosity function from magnitude-limited samples is relatively straightforward, provided that the distances to the objects in the sample are known accurately; techniques for doing this have been available for about 30 yr. However, distances are usually known accurately for only a small subset of the sample. This is true of the objects in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and will be increasingly true of the next generation of deep multicolour photometric surveys. Estimating the luminosity function when distances are only known approximately (e.g. photometric redshifts are available, but spectroscopic redshifts are not) is more difficult. I describe two algorithms which can handle this complication: one is a generalization of the Vmax algorithm, and the other is a maximum likelihood approach. Because these methods account for uncertainties in the distance estimate, they impact a broader range of studies. For example, they are useful for studying the abundances of galaxies which are sufficiently nearby that the contribution of peculiar velocity to the spectroscopic redshift is not negligible, so only a noisy estimate of the true distance is available. In this respect, peculiar velocities and photometric redshift errors have similar effects. The methods developed here are also useful for estimating the stellar luminosity function in samples where accurate parallax distances are not available.},

abstract = {In the next decade, the LSST will become a major facility for the astronomical community. However accurately determining the redshifts of the observed galaxies without using spectroscopy is a major challenge. Reconstruction of the redshifts with high resolution and well-understood uncertainties is mandatory for many science goals, including the study of baryonic acoustic oscillations. We investigate different approaches to establish the accuracy that can be reached by the LSST six-band photometry. We construct a realistic mock galaxy catalog, based on the GOODS survey luminosity function, by simulating the expected apparent magnitude distribution for the LSST. To reconstruct the photometric redshifts (photo-z's), we consider a template-fitting method and a neural network method. The photo-z reconstruction from both of these techniques is tested on real CFHTLS data and also on simulated catalogs. We describe a new method to improve photo-z reconstruction that efficiently removes catastrophic outliers via a likelihood ratio statistical test. This test uses the posterior probability functions of the fit parameters and the colors. We show that the photometric redshift accuracy will meet the stringent LSST requirements up to redshift {\$}\backslashsim2.5{\$} after a selection that is based on the likelihood ratio test or on the apparent magnitude for galaxies with {\$}S/N>5{\$} in at least 5 bands. The former selection has the advantage of retaining roughly 35{\%} more galaxies for a similar photo-z performance compared to the latter. Photo-z reconstruction using a neural network algorithm is also described. In addition, we utilize the CFHTLS spectro-photometric catalog to outline the possibility of combining the neural network and template-fitting methods. We conclude that the photo-z's will be accurately estimated with the LSST if a Bayesian prior probability and a calibration sample are used.},

abstract = {One of the consequences of entering the era of precision cosmology is the widespread adoption of photometric redshift probability density functions (PDFs). Both current and future photometric surveys are expected to obtain images of billions of distinct galaxies. As a result, storing and analysing all of these PDFs will be non-trivial and even more severe if a survey plans to compute and store multiple different PDFs. In this paper we propose the use of a sparse basis representation to fully represent individual photo-z PDFs. By using an orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm and a combination of Gaussian and Voigt basis functions, we demonstrate how our approach is superior to a multi-Gaussian fitting, as we require approximately half of the parameters for the same fitting accuracy with the additional advantage that an entire PDF can be stored by using a 4-byte integer per basis function, and we can achieve better accuracy by increasing the number of bases. By using data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey, we demonstrate that only 10-20 points per galaxy are sufficient to reconstruct both the individual PDFs and the ensemble redshift distribution, N(z), to an accuracy of 99.9 per cent when compared to the one built using the original PDFs computed with a resolution of {\{}delta{\}}z = 0.01, reducing the required storage of 200 original values by a factor of 10-20. Finally, we demonstrate how this basis representation can be directly extended to a cosmological analysis, thereby increasing computational performance without losing resolution nor accuracy.},

abstract = {Photometric surveys produce large-area maps of the galaxy distribution, but with less accurate redshift information than is obtained from spectroscopic methods. Modern photometric redshift (photo-z) algorithms use galaxy magnitudes, or colors, that are obtained through multi-band imaging to produce a probability density function (PDF) for each galaxy in the map. We used simulated data to study the effect of using different photo-z estimators to assign galaxies to redshift bins in order to compare their effects on angular clustering and galaxy bias measurements. We found that if we use the entire PDF, rather than a single-point (mean or mode) estimate, the deviations are less biased, especially when using narrow redshift bins. When the redshift bin widths are {\$}\backslashDelta z=0.1{\$}, the use of the entire PDF reduces the typical measurement bias from 5{\%}, when using single point estimates, to 3{\%}.},
annote = {The good: The intro has a nice review of papers that made use of photo-z PDFs for several applications. They compare using the full PDF to using the mean and mode (and median, and a single random sample), the same two ideas I had for what point estimate into which others might think to reduce full PDFs. They obtain N(z) and the angular correlation function and then extract the galaxy bias as a quantitative measure of how big a difference it makes to use the full PDF, but they do so with point estimates of those parameters rather than treating them like probabilistic objects. They calculated the angular correlation function both with pixel counts and pair counts, ostensibly extending the pixel method to incorporate inclusion probabilities (although no explicit equation is provided and it sounds wrong). The bad: They use TPZ, a random forest method, to get photo-z PDFs (posteriors, I think), but that method does not produce an interim prior (I think, again). They describe the photo-z PDFs in terms of Gaussian statistics but also show a non-Gaussian example, so it's unclear to what degree they're assuming Gaussianity. Though they acknowledge introducing a bias into the clustering amplitude, they include galaxies in each redshift bin over which the angular correlation is calculated only if their PDF in that bin exceeds a threshold, claiming that this reduces noise, which looks like it will destroy the normalization of N(z) and violates the probabilistic aspect of the catalog.  The ugly: They never specify photo-z PDFs as posteriors or likelihoods, and as you noted there are no equations involving conditional probabilities. The photo-z PDFs are stacked to get N(z), but the rest of the calculation of the angular correlation function uses the same catalog of galaxies divided among bins deterministically. They never address the obvious systematics in the measure of the galaxy bias nor the N(z) estimate.},

Four model- or machine learning-based photometric redshift methods -- ANNZ2, BPZ calibrated against BCC-Ufig simulations, SkyNet, and TPZ -- are analysed. For training, calibration, and testing of these methods, we construct a catalogue of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies matched against DES SV data. The performance of the methods is evaluated against the matched spectroscopic catalogue, focusing on metrics relevant for weak lensing analyses, with additional validation against COSMOS photo-zs. From the galaxies in the DES SV shear catalogue, which have mean redshift {\$}0.72\backslashpm0.01{\$} over the range {\$}0.3<z<1.3{\$}, we construct three tomographic bins with means of {\$}z=\backslash{\{}0.45, 0.67, 1.00\backslash{\}}{\$}. These bins each have systematic uncertainties {\$}\backslashdelta z \backslashlesssim 0.05{\$} in the mean of the fiducial SkyNet photo-z {\$}n(z){\$}. We propagate the errors in the redshift distributions through to their impact on cosmological parameters estimated with cosmic shear, and find that they cause shifts in the value of {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}8{\$} of approx. 3{\%}.

abstract = {In a series of previous papers we have considered the reconstruction of the surface mass density of a cluster of galaxies from images of lensed faint background galaxies. We showed that the reconstructed surface mass density is not uniquely determined, but that there exists a global invariance transformation that leaves the shape of the images of the lensed galaxies unchanged. Because of this, only lower limits on the total mass of a cluster can be derived if no further informations besides image ellipticities are used. Throughout these papers we used the simplifying assumption that all sources are at the same redshift. In this paper we account for a redshift distribution of the faint galaxies, and in particular, some of these galaxies can lie in front of the cluster or can be cluster members. We show how the mass distribution of a cluster of galaxies can be obtained from images of these faint galaxies, if the redshift distribution of these galaxies is known. We demonstrate that for the reconstruction of non-critical clusters we need less information on the redshift distribution of the galaxies, i.e., we only need to know two or three moments of the distribution. We show that the mean mass density across the data field is still a free variable, i.e., there remains a global invariance transformation of the resulting mass density field. For non-critical clusters we can derive the transformation explicitly and it is similar to that derived previously for the case of a single redshift of the sources. We discuss several theoretical ideas to break the mass degeneracy; of those considered, we find that only the magnification effect on the number density of galaxy images can be used successfully in practice.},

abstract = {We present a data-driven method to infer the redshift distribution of an arbitrary dataset based on spatial cross-correlation with a reference population and we apply it to various datasets across the electromagnetic spectrum to show its potential and limitations. Our approach advocates the use of clustering measurements on all available scales, in contrast to previous works focusing only on linear scales. We also show how its accuracy can be enhanced by optimally sampling a dataset within its photometric space rather than applying the estimator globally. We show that the ultimate goal of this technique is to characterize the mapping between the space of photometric observables and redshift space as this characterization then allows us to infer the clustering-redshift p.d.f. of a single galaxy. We apply this technique to estimate the redshift distributions of luminous red galaxies and emission line galaxies from the SDSS, infrared sources from WISE and radio sources from FIRST. We show that consistent redshift distributions are found using both quasars and absorber systems as reference populations. This technique brings valuable information on the third dimension of astronomical datasets. It is widely applicable to a large range of extra-galactic surveys.},

abstract = {A survey that can cover the sky in optical bands over wide fields to faint magnitudes with a fast cadence will enable many of the exciting science opportunities of the next decade. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will have an effective aperture of 6.7 meters and an imaging camera with field of view of 9.6 deg{\^{}}2, and will be devoted to a ten-year imaging survey over 20,000 deg{\^{}}2 south of +15 deg. Each pointing will be imaged 2000 times with fifteen second exposures in six broad bands from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to a total point-source depth of r{\~{}}27.5. The LSST Science Book describes the basic parameters of the LSST hardware, software, and observing plans. The book discusses educational and outreach opportunities, then goes on to describe a broad range of science that LSST will revolutionize: mapping the inner and outer Solar System, stellar populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, the structure of the Milky Way disk and halo and other objects in the Local Volume, transient and variable objects both at low and high redshift, and the properties of normal and active galaxies at low and high redshift. It then turns to far-field cosmological topics, exploring properties of supernovae to z{\~{}}1, strong and weak lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and baryon oscillations, and how these different probes may be combined to constrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy.},

abstract = {In this report, we present a wide variety of ways in which information from multiple probes of dark energy may be combined to obtain additional information not accessible when they are considered separately. Fundamentally, because all major probes are affected by the underlying distribution of matter in the regions studied, there exist covariances between them that can provide information on cosmology. Combining multiple probes allows for more accurate (less contaminated by systematics) and more precise (since there is cosmological information encoded in cross-correlation statistics) measurements of dark energy. The potential of cross-correlation methods is only beginning to be realized. By bringing in information from other wavelengths, the capabilities of the existing probes of dark energy can be enhanced and systematic effects can be mitigated further. We present a mixture of work in progress and suggestions for future scientific efforts. Given the scope of future dark energy experiments, the greatest gains may only be realized with more coordination and cooperation between multiple project teams; we recommend that this interchange should begin sooner, rather than later, to maximize scientific gains.},

abstract = {With the growth of large photometric surveys, accurately estimating photometric redshifts, preferably as a probability density function (PDF), and fully understanding the implicit systematic uncertainties in this process, has become increasingly important. In this paper, we present a new, publicly available, parallel, machine learning algorithm that generates photometric redshift PDFs by using prediction trees and random forest techniques, which we have named TPZ.1 This new algorithm incorporates measurement errors into the calculation while also dealing efficiently with missing values in the data. In addition, our implementation of this algorithm provides supplementary information regarding the data being analysed, including unbiased estimates of the accuracy of the technique without resorting to a validation data set, identification of poor photometric redshift areas within the parameter space occupied by the spectroscopic training data, a quantification of the relative importance of the variables used to construct the PDF, and a robust identification of outliers. This extra information can be used to optimally target new spectroscopic observations and to improve the overall efficacy of the redshift estimation. We have tested TPZ on galaxy samples drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) main galaxy sample and from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe-2 (DEEP2) survey, obtaining excellent results in each case. We also have tested our implementation by participating in the PHAT1 project, which is a blind photometric redshift contest, finding that TPZ performs comparable to if not better than other empirical photometric redshift algorithms. Finally, we discuss the various parameters that control the operation of TPZ, the specific limitations of this approach and an application of photometric redshift PDFs.},

This test complements the traditional comparison of redshift {\{}$\backslash$it differences{\}} by testing whether the probability density functions {\$}p(z){\$} have the correct {\{}$\backslash$it width{\}}. We test two photometric redshift codes, BPZ and EAZY, on each of two data sets and find that BPZ is consistently overconfident (the {\$}p(z){\$} are too narrow) while EAZY produces approximately the correct level of confidence. We show that this is because EAZY models the uncertainty in its spectral energy distribution templates, and that post-hoc smoothing of the BPZ {\$}p(z){\$} provides a reasonable substitute for detailed modeling of template uncertainties. Either remedy still leaves a small surplus of galaxies with spectroscopic redshift very far from the peaks. Thus, better modeling of low-probability tails will be needed for high-precision work such as dark energy constraints with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and other large surveys.},

abstract = {We present a new cluster detection algorithm designed for finding high-redshift clusters using optical/infrared imaging data. The algorithm has two main characteristics. First, it utilizes each galaxy's full redshift probability function, instead of an estimate of the photometric redshift based on the peak of the probability function and an associated Gaussian error. Second, it identifies cluster candidates through cross-checking the results of two substantially different selection techniques (the name 2TecX representing the cross-check of the two techniques). These are adaptations of the Voronoi Tesselations and Friends-Of-Friends methods. Monte Carlo simulations of mock catalogues show that cross-checking the cluster candidates found by the two techniques significantly reduces the detection of spurious sources. Furthermore, we examine the selection effects and relative strengths and weaknesses of either method. The simulations also allow us to fine-tune the algorithm's parameters, and define completeness and mass limit as a function of redshift. We demonstrate that the algorithm isolates high-redshift clusters at a high level of efficiency and low contamination.},

abstract = {We present an empirical method for estimating the underlying redshift distribution N(z) of galaxy photometric samples from photometric observables. The method does not rely on photometric redshift (photo-z) estimates for individual galaxies, which typically suffer from biases. Instead, it assigns weights to galaxies in a spectroscopic subsample such that the weighted distributions of photometric observables (e.g. multiband magnitudes) match the corresponding distributions for the photometric sample. The weights are estimated using a nearest neighbour technique that ensures stability in sparsely populated regions of colour-magnitude space. The derived weights are then summed in redshift bins to create the redshift distribution. We apply this weighting technique to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as well as to mock catalogues for the Dark Energy Survey, and compare the results to those from the estimation of photo-zs derived by a neural network algorithm. We find that the weighting method accurately recovers the underlying redshift distribution, typically better than the photo-z reconstruction, provided the spectroscopic subsample spans the range of photometric observables covered by the photometric sample.},

By developing a spectroscopic model for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) stellar locus in colour-colour space, synthesizing an expected stellar locus, and simultaneously solving for all unknown zero-points when fitting to the instrumental locus, we increase the calibration accuracy of stellar locus matching. We also use a new combined technique to estimate improved flat-field models for the Subaru SuprimeCam camera, forming  star flats' based on the magnitudes of stars observed in multiple positions or through comparison with available measurements in the SDSS catalogue. These techniques yield galaxy magnitudes with reliable colour calibration ([lsim]0.01-0.02 mag accuracy) that enable us to estimate photometric redshift probability distributions without spectroscopic training samples. We test the accuracy of our photometric redshifts using spectroscopic redshifts zs for [{\~{}}]5000 galaxies in 27cluster fields with at least five bands of photometry, as well as galaxies in the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field, finding {\{}sigma{\}}((zp - zs)/(1 + zs)) {\{}approx{\}} 0.03 for the most probable redshift zp. We show that the full posterior probability distributions for the redshifts of galaxies with five-band photometry exhibit good agreement with redshifts estimated from thirty-band photometry in the COSMOS field. The growth of shear with increasing distance behind each galaxy cluster shows the expected redshift-distance relation for a flat {\{}Lambda{\}} cold dark matter ({\{}Lambda{\}}-CDM) cosmology. Photometric redshifts and calibrated colours are used in subsequent papers to measure the masses of 51 galaxy clusters from their weak gravitational shear and determine improved cosmological constraints.

In this paper, we extend this method and explore various applications of it, using both simulations and real data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In addition to estimating the redshift distribution for an entire sample, the weighting method enables accurate estimates of the redshift probability distribution, p(z), for each galaxy in a photometric sample. Use of p(z) in cosmological analyses can substantially reduce biases associated with traditional photometric redshifts, in which a single redshift estimate is associated with each galaxy. The weighting procedure also naturally indicates which galaxies in the photometric sample are expected to have accurate redshift estimates, namely those that lie in regions of photometric-observable space that are well sampled by the spectroscopic subsample. In addition to providing a method that has some advantages over standard photo-z estimates, the weights method can also be used in conjunction with photo-z estimates e.g. by providing improved estimation of N(z) via deconvolution of N(zphot) and improved estimates of photo-z scatter and bias.

We demonstrate that the redshift probability distribution function summed over galaxies provides an accurate representation of the galaxy redshift distribution accounting for random and catastrophic errors for galaxies with best fitting photometric redshifts z{\_}p < 1.3.   We present cosmological constraints using tomographic weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure. We use two broad redshift bins 0.5 < z{\_}p <= 0.85 and 0.85 < z{\_}p <= 1.3 free of intrinsic alignment contamination, and measure the shear correlation function on angular scales in the range {\~{}}1-40 arcmin. We show that the problematic redshift scaling of the shear signal, found in previous CFHTLS data analyses, does not afflict the CFHTLenS data. For a flat Lambda-CDM model and a fixed matter density Omega{\_}m=0.27, we find the normalisation of the matter power spectrum sigma{\_}8=0.771 $\backslash$pm 0.041. When combined with cosmic microwave background data (WMAP7), baryon acoustic oscillation data (BOSS), and a prior on the Hubble constant from the HST distance ladder, we find that CFHTLenS improves the precision of the fully marginalised parameter estimates by an average factor of 1.5-2.

Throughout the interval -16.5 > [IMG]/medium/336-3-907-ieq001.gif" ALT="Formula ">- 5 log10h > -22, the luminosity function is accurately described by a Schechter function with [IMG]/medium/336-3-907-ieq002.gif" ALT="Formula ">- 5 log10h=-19.66 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.07, =-1.21 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.03 and {\{}Phi{\}}[*]= (1.61 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.08) x 10-2h3 Mpc-3, giving an integrated luminosity density of {\{}rho{\}}L= (1.82 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.17) x 108h L{\{}odot{\}} Mpc-3 (assuming an {\{}Omega{\}}0= 0.3, {\{}Lambda{\}}0= 0.7 cosmology). The quoted errors have contributions from the accuracy of the photometric zero-point, from large-scale structure in the galaxy distribution and, importantly, from the uncertainty in the appropriate evolutionary corrections. Our luminosity function is in excellent agreement with, but has much smaller statistical errors than, an estimate from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data when the SDSS data are accurately translated to the bJ band and the luminosity functions are normalized in the same way. We use the luminosity function, along with maps describing the redshift completeness of the current 2dFGRS catalogue, and its weak dependence on apparent magnitude, to define a complete description of the 2dFGRS selection function. Details and tests of the calibration of the 2dFGRS photometric parent catalogue are also presented.},

Despite its relatively long history, the technique of photometric redshifts remains far from being a mature tool. Areas needing development include the use of spatial structure, the incorporation of large redshift samples with multicolor photometry for empirical calibrations of redshift errors, and improved analysis tools that directly include redshift probability distributions rather than singular values. Photometric redshifts has not only undergone a recent revival -- it is also rapidly becoming a crucial tool of mainstream observational cosmology.},

We are able to obtain a probability density function (PDF) for each galaxy using a classification NN. The method is applied to 58 714 galaxies in CFHTLenS that have spectroscopic redshifts from DEEP2, VVDS and VIPERS. Using this data, we show that the stacked PDFs give an excellent representation of the true N(z) using information from 5, 4 or 3 photometric bands. We show that the fractional error due to using N(zphot) instead of N(ztruth) is [{\&}le;]1 per cent on the lensing power spectrum (P{\{}kappa{\}}) in several tomographic bins. Further, we investigate how well this method performs when few training samples are available and show that in this regime the NN slightly overestimates the N(z) at high z. Finally, the case where the training sample is not representative of the full data set is investigated.},

abstract = {We report weak-lensing masses for 51 of the most X-ray luminous galaxy clusters known. This cluster sample, introduced earlier in this series of papers, spans redshifts 0.15 [lsim] zcl [lsim] 0.7, and is well suited to calibrate mass proxies for current cluster cosmology experiments. Cluster masses are measured with a standard  colour-cut' lensing method from three-filter photometry of each field. Additionally, for 27 cluster fields with at least five-filter photometry, we measure high-accuracy masses using a new method that exploits all information available in the photometric redshift posterior probability distributions of individual galaxies. Using simulations based on the COSMOS-30 catalogue, we demonstrate control of systematic biases in the mean mass of the sample with this method, from photometric redshift biases and associated uncertainties, to better than 3 per cent. In contrast, we show that the use of single-point estimators in place of the full photometric redshift posterior distributions can lead to significant redshift-dependent biases on cluster masses. The performance of our new photometric redshift-based method allows us to calibrate  colour-cut' masses for all 51 clusters in the present sample to a total systematic uncertainty of {\{}approx{\}}7 per cent on the mean mass, a level sufficient to significantly improve current cosmology constraints from galaxy clusters. Our results bode well for future cosmological studies of clusters, potentially reducing the need for exhaustive spectroscopic calibration surveys as compared to other techniques, when deep, multifilter optical and near-IR imaging surveys are coupled with robust photometric redshift methods.},

One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to {\$}\backslashsim N{\^{}}2{\$} for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation and API.

abstract = {The estimation and utilization of photometric redshift probability density functions (photo-z PDFs) have become increasingly important over the last few years and currently there exist a wide variety of algorithms to compute photo-z's, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we present a novel and efficient Bayesian framework that combines the results from different photo-z techniques into a more powerful and robust estimate by maximizing the information from the photometric data. To demonstrate this, we use a supervised machine learning technique based on random forest, an unsupervised method based on self-organizing maps, and a standard template-fitting method but can be easily extended to other existing techniques. We use data from the DEEP2 survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to explore different methods for combining the predictions from these techniques. By using different performance metrics, we demonstrate that we can improve the accuracy of our final photo-z estimate over the best input technique, that the fraction of outliers is reduced, and that the identification of outliers is significantly improved when we apply a naive Bayes classifier to this combined information. Our more robust and accurate photo-z PDFs will allow even more precise cosmological constraints to be made by using current and future photometric surveys. These improvements are crucial as we move to analyse photometric data that push to or even past the limits of the available training data, which will be the case with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.},

abstract = {The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) experiment requires a sufficiently dense sampling of large-scale structure tracers with spectroscopic redshift, which is observationally expensive especially at high redshifts {\$}z\backslashsimgt 1{\$}. Here we present an alternative route of the BAO analysis that uses the cross-correlation of sparse spectroscopic tracers with a much denser photometric sample, where the spectroscopic tracers can be quasars or bright, rare galaxies that are easier to access spectroscopically. We show that measurements of the cross-correlation as a function of the transverse comoving separation rather than the angular separation avoid a smearing of the BAO feature without mixing the different scales at different redshifts in the projection, even for a wide redshift slice {\$}\backslashDelta z\backslashsimeq 1{\$}. The bias, scatter, and catastrophic redshift errors of the photometric sample affect only the overall normalization of the cross-correlation which can be marginalized over when constraining the angular diameter distance. As a specific example, we forecast an expected accuracy of the BAO geometrical test via the cross-correlation of the SDSS and BOSS spectroscopic quasar sample with a dense photometric galaxy sample that is assumed to have a full overlap with the SDSS/BOSS survey region. We show that this cross-correlation BAO analysis allows us to measure the angular diameter distances to a fractional accuracy of about 10{\%} at each redshift bin over {\$}1\backslashsimlt z\backslashsimlt 3{\$}, if the photometric redshift errors of the galaxies, {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}z/(1+z){\$}, are better than 10-20{\%} level.},
