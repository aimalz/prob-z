Cosmological Hierarchical Inference with Probabilistic Photometric Redshifts.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aimalz/chippr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aimalz/chippr)[![Documentation Status](http://readthedocs.org/projects/chippr/badge/?version=latest)](http://chippr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)


## Motivation

This repository is the home of `chippr`, a Python package for estimating quantities of cosmological interest from surveys of photometric redshift posterior probability distributions.

## Examples

You can run the `chippr` IPython notebooks live over the web at [Binder](http://mybinder.org):

To make sure you are running the latest version, you can rebuild the Binder `chippr` installation [here](http://mybinder.org/status/aimalz/chippr).

You can also browse the (un-executed) notebooks here in this repo:
