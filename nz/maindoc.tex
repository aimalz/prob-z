\section{Introduction}

The redshift distribution function $N(z)$ shown in Eq. \ref{eq:distribution} gives the number of galaxies per unit redshift, effectively quantifying evolution in the number of galaxies.  \citep{men13}  According to Eq. \ref{eq:density}, the redshift distribution function is related to the redshift density function $n(z)$, which gives the number of galaxies per unit redshift per unit volume.  The redshift density function provides additional information about cosmology via the rate of expansion over redshift.

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:distribution}
N(z) &=& \frac{dN}{dz}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:density}
n(z) &=& \frac{dN}{dz\ d\Omega}
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Probabilistic Model}

We would like to learn the redshift density function $n(z)$.  The true redshifts $z$ of galaxies are parameters we would like to estimate, and the parameters $\vec{\theta}$ determining $n(z)$ may be considered hyperparameters that determine the probability density of true redshifts.  The density we aim to estimate may be expressed as Eq. \ref{eq:params}.

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:params}
p(z|\vec{\theta}) &=& \frac{N(z)}{\int N(z)\ dz} = \frac{N(z)}{E[N(z)]}
\end{eqnarray}

Let us consider a photometric survey of $J$ galaxies $j$, each with a set of observed magnitudes (and errors) in several filters that comprise data point $\vec{d}_{j}$ for each galaxy.  Each galaxy has a redshift $z_{j}$ as a parameter we wish to estimate.  Collectively, the distribution of redshifts over all the surveyed galaxies is governed by $\vec{\theta}$ as a hyperparameter we also wish to estimate.  We may express this problem in terms of the graphical model of Fig. \ref{fig:flow}.

\begin{figure}
\label{fig:flow}
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1cm]

\node (nz) [hyper] {$\vec{\theta}$};
\node (z) [param, below of=nz,yshift=-0.25cm] {$z_{j}$};
\node (mags) [data, below of=z] {$\vec{d}_{j}$};
\node (survey) [draw=black,fit={(mags.west)(z.north)(mags.south)(mags.east)}] {};
\node [xshift=1.5cm,yshift=0.25cm] at (survey.south) {$j=1,\dots,J$};

\draw [arrow] (nz) -- (z);
\draw [arrow] (z) -- (mags);

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{This directed acyclic graph illustrates a hierarchical model.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

For the purposes of this derivation, we assume the data for the entire survey $\{\vec{d}_{j}\}_{J}$ are independent measurements of the $J$ data points $\vec{d}_{j}$, where $J$ itself is a Poisson random variable with expected value $J_{0}$.  However, this assumption that $z_{j}$ is independent of $z_{j'}$ must be false because of the shared physical processes governing observations of galaxies $j\neq j'$, such as the instruments with which they were observed and the covariances of $N(z)$.  Nonetheless, this assumption must be made in order to make the problem tractable.  Thus the likelihood of observing this data given a model $\vec{\theta}$ is said to be a set of independent samples $p(\vec{d}_{j}|\vec{\theta})$ with a shared $\vec{\theta}$ and can be expressed as Eq. \ref{eq:indie}.  \citep{for14}  It is important to note that $int N(z)\ dz$ is not constrained to be $J$ for the arbitrary proposed parameters $\vec{\theta}$.

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:indie}
p(\{\vec{d}_{j}\}_{J}|\vec{\theta}) &=& e^{-\int N(z)\ dz}\prod_{j=1}^{J}p(\vec{d}_{j}|\vec{\theta})
\end{eqnarray}

We may apply Bayes' Rule, as in Eq. \ref{eq:bayes} to find the posterior probability of the hyperparameters $p(\vec{\theta}|\{\vec{d}_{j}\}_{J})$ from the likelihoods of Eq. \ref{eq:indie}.  Combining Eq. \ref{eq:indie} with Eq. \ref{eq:bayes} yields Eq. \ref{eq:posterior}.  We can further expand Eq. \ref{eq:posterior} into Eq. \ref{eq:marginalize} by involving the redshifts as parameters.

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:bayes}
p(\vec{\theta}|\{\vec{d}_{j}\}_{J}) &=& \frac{p(\vec{\theta})}{p(\{\vec{d}_{j}\}_{J})}p(\{\vec{d}_{j}\}_{J}|\theta)
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:posterior}
p(\vec{\theta}|\{\vec{d}_{j}\}_{J}) &=& \frac{p(\vec{\theta})}{p(\{\vec{d}_{j}\}_{J})}e^{-\int N(z)\ dz}\prod_{j=1}^{J}p(\vec{d}_{j}|\vec{\theta})
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:marginalize}
p(\vec{\theta}|\{\vec{d}_{j}\}_{J}) &=& \frac{p(\vec{\theta})}{p(\{\vec{d}_{j}\}_{J})}e^{-\int N(z)\ dz}\prod_{j=1}^{J}\int\ p(\vec{d}_{j}|z_{j})\ p(z_{j}|\vec{\theta})\ dz_{j}
\end{eqnarray}

However, Eq. \ref{eq:marginalize} contains likelihoods $p(\vec{d}_{j}|z_{j})$ that in this case are inaccessible; to obtain likelihoods for photometric redshifts, we would have to be able to normalize by integrating over all possible data, requiring more information than is available from any observations we can make.  What we can measure are the posteriors for the redshifts of individual galaxies, $p(z_{j}|\vec{d}_{j})$.  (This has been done by \citet{she11}, for example.)  Instead, we would like to have posteriors rather than likelihoods in Eq. \ref{eq:marginalize}.  To perform this transformation, we follow the reasoning of \citet{mar15}.  

Let us consider the probability of the parameters $z_{j}$ conditioned on the data and an interim prior value of the hyperparameters $\vec{\theta}_{0}$ and rewrite Eq. \ref{eq:marginalize} as Eq. \ref{eq:trick}.  (While we would like any interim prior to be uninformative, this is rarely achievable, so we must be sure to integrate it out to avoid biasing our conclusions by this choice.)  We may then expand the denominator according to Eq. \ref{eq:bayes} to get Eq. \ref{eq:expand}.  The likelihood terms cancel as $p(\vec{d}_{j}|z_{j},\vec{\theta}_{0})=p(\vec{d}_{j}|z_{j})\ p(\vec{d}_{j}|\vec{\theta}_{0})$, yielding Eq. \ref{eq:cancel}.

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:trick}
p(\vec{\theta}|\{\vec{d}_{j}\}_{J}) &=& \frac{p(\vec{\theta})}{p(\{\vec{d}_{j}\}_{J})}e^{-\int N(z)\ dz}\prod_{j=1}^{J}\int\ p(\vec{d}_{j}|z_{j})\ p(z_{j}|\vec{\theta})\ \frac{p(z_{j}|\vec{d}_{j},\vec{\theta}_{0})}{p(z_{j}|\vec{d}_{j},\vec{\theta}_{0})}\ dz_{j}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:expand}
p(\vec{\theta}|\{\vec{d}_{j}\}_{J}) &=& \frac{p(\vec{\theta})}{p(\{\vec{d}_{j}\}_{J})}e^{-\int N(z)\ dz}\prod_{j=1}^{J}\int\ p(\vec{d}_{j}|z_{j})\ p(z_{j}|\vec{\theta})\ p(z_{j}|\vec{d}_{j},\vec{\theta}_{0})\ \frac{p(\vec{d}_{j}|\vec{\theta}_{0})}{p(\vec{d}_{j}|z_{j},\vec{\theta}_{0})\ p(z_{j}|\vec{\theta}_{0})}\ dz_{j}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:cancel}
p(\vec{\theta}|\{\vec{d}_{j}\}_{J}) &=& \frac{p(\vec{\theta})}{p(\{\vec{d}_{j}\}_{J})}e^{-\int N(z)\ dz}\prod_{j=1}^{J}\ \int\ p(z_{j}|\vec{d}_{j},\vec{\theta}_{0})\ \frac{p(z_{j}|\vec{\theta})}{p(z_{j}|\vec{\theta}_{0})}\ dz_{j}
\end{eqnarray}

The argument of the integral in the posterior of Eq. \ref{eq:cancel} depends solely on knowable quantities and can be calculated for a given data set.  We will have to assume a prior $p(\vec{\theta})$ for the hyperparameters.   Since we cannot know $p(\{\vec{d}_{j}\}_{J})$, we sample the desired distribution $p(\vec{\theta}|\{\vec{d}_{j}\}_{J})$ using Monte Carlo-Markov chain (MCMC) methods.  

\section{Mock Data}
\label{sec:mock}

We consider the $K=35$ redshift bins $B_{k}=[z^{B}_{k-1},z^{B}_{k}]$ over a range from $z_{0}=0$ to $z_{35}=1.1$ for which \citet{she11} calculated posteriors for the redshift of each galaxy based on observations of the apparent magnitude in the five photmetric filters of SDSS.  We shall take $\vec{\theta}$ to be a discretized parametrization of $N(z)$, where $\exp[\theta_{k}]$ is the average value of $N(z)$ over the redshift range of bin $B_{k}$.   Thus the expected number $J_{k}$ of galaxies in each bin is $\exp[\theta_{k}]\Delta_{k}$, where $\Delta_{k}\equiv z_{k}-z_{k-1}$, transforming Eq. \ref{eq:params} into Eq. \ref{eq:dparams}.  

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:dparams}
p(B_{k}|\vec{\theta}) &\equiv& \frac{J_{k}}{J} = \frac{\exp[\theta_{k}]\Delta_{k}}{J}
%N(B_{k}) &=& \theta_{k} = J\tilde{\theta}_{k}\Delta_{k}% \frac{\mathcal{N}_{k}}{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\mathcal{N}_{k}}
\end{eqnarray}

In order to simulate data, we select set a true, physically motivated redshift probability distribution $p^{0}(z|\vec{\theta})$, where $p(z|\vec{\theta})$ corresponds to $\vec{\theta}$ for $J=1$.  The convolution of a linear function and a sum of Gaussians is quite general and accurately generates features observed in the true $N(z)$.  (Cite this!)  The instance of $p^{0}(z)$ here is shown in Eq. \ref{eq:truepz}, where the constant $C_{c}$ indicates the relative amplitude of the Gaussian component centered at $z_{c}$ with variance $\sigma_{c}^{2}$.  The linear function is evaluated at the centers of the bins $\bar{z}_{k}=(z_{k+1}-z_{k})/2$ and is included to ensure that $\lim_{z\to0}N(z)=0$.  The construction of this probability density is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:truepz}.  

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:truepz}
p^{0}(z_{k}) &=& \sum_{c=1}^{6}\bar{z}_{k}C_{c}\int_{z_{k}}^{z_{k+1}} \mathcal{N}(z_{c},\sigma^{2}_{c})dz
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{figure}
\label{fig:truepz}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{truePz.png}
\caption{We construct $p^{0}$ as a sum of Gaussians.}
\end{figure}

We evaluate $p^{0}(z)$ over each bin to obtain $\vec{\theta}^{0}$ according to Eq. \ref{eq:truenz}, whose construction is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:truepz}.  The number of galaxies $J$ is selected from a Poisson distribution centered at an arbitrary $J_{0}=10,000$ galaxies.

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:truenz}
\theta_{k}^{0} &\equiv& \ln\left[J\int_{z_{k}}^{z_{k+1}}p^{0}(z) dz\right]
\end{eqnarray}

Next, we generate galaxy redshift likelihood functions as follows.  We first assign a bin number $b_{j}=k$ from $k=1,\dots,K$ to each galaxy $j$ by randomly sampling the $K$ bins with weights given by the true redshift function as $\int_{z_{k}}^{z_{k+1}}p^{0}(z)dz$.  Examples of some such samples for a fixed $J=1,000$ are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:obsnz}.

\begin{figure}
\label{fig:obsnz}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{obsNz.png}
\caption{Samples of the number of galaxies in each bin are generated as Poisson draws.}
\end{figure}

We then assign each galaxy a true redshift $z_{j}$ chosen uniformly from within the bin $B_{b_{j}}$ to which it was assigned.  The true redshift of each galaxy is shifted by a random error according to Eq. \ref{eq:zshift} to simulate inaccuracy in measurements, yielding a shifted redshift $z_{j}'$ for each galaxy.  Fig. \ref{fig:samples} shows histograms of the mock data generated.  It is worth noting that any method aiming to calculate the posterior should be unable to do better than the ``observed redshifts'' that go into generating the data.  SOMEHOW THIS IS NOT TRUE FOR THIS DATA, BUT HOW?

\begin{mathletters}
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:zshift}
z_{j}' &=& z_{j}+e_{j}\\
p(e_{j}) &=& \mathcal{N}(0,\delta_{j})\nonumber\\
\delta_{j} &=& \frac{\sum_{b_{k}=1}^{K}(z_{b_{k}}-z_{b_{k}-1)}}{K}(1+z_{j})\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
\end{mathletters}

\begin{figure}
\label{fig:samples}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{exdata.png}
\caption{The true $\vec{\theta}$ chosen for this test is plotted here, along with histograms of the true redshifts sampled from it and the shifted redshifts resulting from the mock data generation procedure.}
\end{figure}

The discretized posterior $p(B_{k}|\vec{d}_{j})$ for each galaxy is taken to be Gaussian with a mean equal to the shifted redshift and a standard deviation proportional to $1+z_{j}$ to simulate the fact that uncertainty increases with redshift.  According to the above, "the data" are thus comprised of $J$ pairs $(z_{j}',\delta_{j})$.  The observed probability that galaxy $j$ has a redshift in bin $k$ is given by Eq. \ref{eq:zdist}.  As a final step, all posteriors are normalized such that they integrate to unity over the redshift range spanned by the bins.  Fig. \ref{fig:pzs} shows a few examples of simulated posteriors.

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:zdist}
p(B_{k}|\vec{d_{j}}) = \int_{z_{k}}^{z_{k+1}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\delta_{j}^{2}}}\exp\left[-\frac{(z_{j}'-z)^{2}}{2\delta_{j}^{2}}\right]\ dz
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{figure}
\label{fig:pzs}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{lik-samps.png}
\caption{Several random redshift likelihood functions are shown here.  Note that the width of the Gaussian increases with redshift.}
\end{figure}

The posterior for the entire dataset introduced in Eq. \ref{eq:cancel} may be re-expressed as Eq. \ref{eq:fullpost} in terms of the $K$ bins.  It is valuable to verify that the posterior is maximized for the true $N(z)$ that generated a particular set of simulated data.

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:fullpost}
p(\vec{\theta}|\{\vec{d}_{j}\}_{J}) &=& \frac{p(\vec{\theta})}{p(\{\vec{d}_{j}\}_{J})}\ \exp\left[-\sum_{k=1}^{K}\exp[\theta_{k}]\Delta_{k}\right]\ \prod_{j=1}^{J}\ \sum_{k=1}^{K}\ p(B_{k}|\vec{d}_{j})\ \frac{\exp[\theta_{k}]}{\exp[\theta_{k}^{0}]}\Delta_{k}
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Application}

The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is applied to sample the posterior of Eq. \ref{eq:fullpost}.  We work with log probabilities from this point forward for computational efficiency and numerical stability.  Since $p(\{\vec{d}_{j}\}_{J})$ is in general unknown, we will also commence working with $\tilde{p}(\vec{\theta}|\{\vec{d}_{j}\}_{J})$, a quantity proportional to Eq. \ref{eq:fullpost}, which shall be called the "pseudo-posterior," the log of which is given in Eq. \ref{eq:logpost}.

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:logpost}
\ln[\tilde{p}(\vec{\theta}|\{\vec{d}_{j}\}_{J})] &=& \ln[p(\vec{\theta})]-\exp[\vec{\theta}]\cdot\vec{\Delta}+\sum_{j=1}^{J}\ \ln\left[\sum_{k=1}^{K}\ \exp\left[\ln[p(B_{k}|\vec{d}_{j})]+\theta_{k}-\theta_{k}^{0}+\ln[\Delta_{k}]\right]\right]
\end{eqnarray}

The procedure is initialized with an interim prior equal to a multivariate normal distribution with mean and covariance given by Eq. \ref{eq:covmat}.  The mean chosen here is that of a flat distribution.  The constants $q$, $a$, and $e$ are small numbers chosen to permit draws from the distribution in question to reproduce shapes similar to that of the true $N(z)$ set in Sec. \ref{sec:mock}.

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:covmat}
\theta^{0}_{k} &=& \ln[J_{0}]-\ln[K]-\ln[\Delta_{k}]\\
\Sigma_{kk'} &=& q\exp^{-\frac{a(k-k')^{2}}{2}}+e\cdot\mathbb{I}
\end{eqnarray}

At each iteration $i$, a proposal distribution $\vec{\theta}^{i}$ generated from the prior distribution shown in Eq. \ref{eq:covmat}.  Some examples of samples from the initialization value are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:priors}.

\begin{figure}
\label{fig:priors}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{samples5.png}
\caption{Several random samples of $\vec{\theta}$ from the distribution of Eq. \ref{eq:covmat} are shown here.  %As $a$ increases, more peaks are permitted and the distribution becomes less smooth.  For a set value of $q$, the amplitude of deviations from the mean decreases with $a$.
}
\end{figure}

The following pseudo-code outlines the algorithm.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{it:randsamp} Randomly sample Eq. \ref{eq:covmat} to generate a proposal $\vec{\theta}'$.
\item Calculate the log pseudo-posterior as in Eq. \ref{eq:logpost} to produce $\ln\tilde{p}(\vec{\theta}'|\{vec{d}_{j}\}_{J})$.
\item Calculate $r=\ln\tilde{p}(\vec{\theta}'|\{vec{d}_{j}\}_{J})-\ln\tilde{p}(\vec{\theta}|\{vec{d}_{j}\}_{J})$.
\item If $r\geq0$, set and record $\vec{\theta}=\vec{\theta}'$.\\
If $r<0$, select a random number $n$ from the uniform distribution between 0 and 1.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $n<\exp[r]$, record $\vec{\theta}_{r+1}=\vec{\theta}'$ and set $\vec{\theta}=\vec{\theta}'$
\end{enumerate}
\item Check if the threshold has been achieved; if not, return to Step \ref{it:randsamp}.
\end{enumerate}

Here, the threshold was $I=10^{4}$ iterations.  All accepted proposals from one instance of the code are shown in Fig. %\ref{fig:results}
.  The acceptance fraction was $\sim0.1\%$ for this and other runs.  Since 10000 iterations likely doesn't even get through the ``burn-in'' period of the algorithm, this acceptance fraction is not surprising!  If I were convinced it were otherwise valid, I would run it until some convergence criterion were achieved.  However, since that might take quite some time, I will conservatively refrain from doing so.

%\label{fig:results}
%\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{compare-results.png}
%\caption{Accepted proposal values of $\vec{\mathcal{N}}$ are shown here, along with the true value in black.}
%\end{figure}

\section{Discussion}

It is desirable to compare this result to what would have been obtained by the method of \citet{she11}, which directly calculates the posterior for the entire dataset using the posteriors for each galaxy according to Eq. \ref{eq:sheldon}.

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:sheldon}
p(B_{k}) &=& \sum_{r=1}^{R}p_{r}(B_{k}|\vec{d}_{j})
\end{eqnarray}

To do this, I calculate the posteriors $p(z|\vec{d}_{j})$ for each galaxy using Eq. \ref{eq:posts}, the product of the estimate of $\vec{\theta}$ and the likelihood for each galaxy.  This is done for all accepted values of $\vec{\theta}$.

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:posts}
p_{r}(B_{k}|\vec{d}_{j}) &=& p(\vec{d}_{j}|B_{k})p(\vec{\theta}^{r}|\textul{D})
\end{eqnarray}

Fig. \ref{fig:sheldon} compares the result of summing the posteriors as in Eq. \ref{eq:sheldon} with the result of the MCMC solutions of Eq. \ref{eq:bayes}.  The method of \citet{she11} underestimates the probability of observing low redshifts.  As one would expect, the MCMC estimate irreversibly loses some substructure because of the shifting error added to the simulated data.

\begin{figure}
\label{fig:sheldon}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{compare-sheldon.png}
\caption{The result of applying Eq. \ref{eq:sheldon} is shown in red, the average accepted posterior sample from the method presented here is shown in blue, and $p(z)$ for the observable redshifts of Eq. \ref{eq:zshift} is shown in black.  The sum of squared differences between the result of each method and the true value are also shown; one can see that the \citet{she11} approach has larger errors.}
